# Credit-Risk-Analysis
The aim of this project was to utilize machine learning models to analyze and forecast the likelihood of a customer defaulting on a loan. 
The project's main focus was on credit risk assessment and involved the analysis of various factors that could potentially affect loan repayment, such as income, credit score, and employment status.

To accomplish this goal, a diverse set of machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, were used to build predictive models. 
The models were trained on a large dataset of historical loan data, including information on customers who defaulted and those who did not.

The project's outcome was the development of accurate and reliable models capable of predicting a customer's likelihood of defaulting on a loan. 
These models can be used by lending institutions to make more informed decisions when assessing credit risk, thereby reducing the likelihood of loan defaults and ultimately improving their bottom line.
